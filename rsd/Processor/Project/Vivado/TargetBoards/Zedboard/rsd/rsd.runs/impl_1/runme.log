WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/RSD_0/inst/main/main/core/genblk1[0].array/tagValidArray/array_reg_0 has an input control pin design_1_i/RSD_0/inst/main/main/core/genblk1[0].array/tagValidArray/array_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: design_1_i/RSD_0/inst/main/main/core/npStageIF\\.icNextReadAddrIn[addr][7]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/RSD_0/inst/main/main/rstController/rst_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
