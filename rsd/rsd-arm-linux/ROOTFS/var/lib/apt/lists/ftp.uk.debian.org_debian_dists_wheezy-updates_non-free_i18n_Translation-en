 Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for Unix. The main purpose of
 this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
 scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable
 multi-threaded daemon in the clamav-daemon package, a command-line
 scanner in the clamav package, and a tool for automatic updating via
 the Internet in the clamav-freshclam package. The programs are based
 on libclamav7, which can be used by other software.

 This package provides support for RAR packaged files or mail attachments.
 Support will be available once this package is installed and clamd or a local
 clamscan is restarted.
