Package: apache2-mpm-event
Description-md5: a80d3fe69689b28f8aea325690e6e8f5
Description-en: Apache HTTP Server - event driven model
 Each Apache Multi-Processing Module provides a different "flavor" of
 web server binary, compiled with a different processing model.
 .
 The event MPM is designed to allow more requests to be served
 simultaneously by passing off some processing work to supporting
 threads, freeing up the main threads to work on new requests. It is
 especially suitable for sites that see extensive KeepAlive traffic.
 .
 This MPM is experimental and less tested than the worker and prefork MPMs.

Package: apache2-mpm-itk
Description-md5: 852c600a072cd8e2a37f461a6a0916ad
Description-en: multiuser MPM for Apache 2.2
 The ITK Multi-Processing Module (MPM) works in about the same way as the
 classical "prefork" module (that is, without threads), except that it allows
 you to constrain each individual vhost to a particular system user. This
 allows you to run several different web sites on a single server without
 worrying that they will be able to read each others' files. This is a
 third-party MPM that is not included in the normal Apache httpd.
 .
 Please note that this MPM is somewhat less tested than the MPMs that come with
 Apache itself.

Package: apache2-mpm-prefork
Description-md5: b1e3963f43f27f985efabc714e30a17e
Description-en: Apache HTTP Server - traditional non-threaded model
 Each Apache Multi-Processing Module provides a different "flavor" of
 web server binary, compiled with a different processing model.
 .
 The prefork MPM provides a non-threaded implementation using a variable
 number of processes where each process handles only one connection
 at the same time. It is not as fast as threaded models, but is considered to
 be more stable. It is appropriate for sites that need to maintain
 compatibility with non-thread-safe libraries, and is the best MPM for
 isolating each request, so that a problem with a single request will not
 affect any other.

Package: apache2-mpm-worker
Description-md5: 5c9df5383d0a2631ae15ced2ca0389d7
Description-en: Apache HTTP Server - high speed threaded model
 Each Apache Multi-Processing Module provides a different "flavor" of
 web server binary, compiled with a different processing model.
 .
 The worker MPM provides the default threaded implementation. It is
 recommended especially for high-traffic sites because it is faster
 and has a smaller memory footprint than the traditional prefork MPM.

Package: apt-cacher
Description-md5: 658b52594d1b65a7b1e4ede7b411bfe8
Description-en: Caching proxy for Debian package and source files
 Apt-cacher performs caching of files requested by apt-get (or other clients
 such as aptitude, synaptic). It is most useful for local area networks with
 slow internet uplink or as a method for reducing multiple large downloads.
 .
 When a package is requested, the cache checks whether it already has the
 requested version, in which case it sends the package to the user immediately.
 If not, it downloads the package while streaming it to the user at the same
 time. A local copy is then kept for use by other users.
 .
 Apt-cacher has been optimized for best utilization of network bandwidth and
 efficiency even on slow low-memory servers. Multiple ways of installation are
 possible: as a stand-alone HTTP proxy, as a daemon executed by inetd or as a
 CGI program (deprecated). Client machines are configured by changing APT's
 proxy configuration or modification of access URLs in sources.list.
 .
 The package includes utilities to clean the cache (removing obsolete package
 files), generate usage reports and import existing package files.  Optional
 features include a simple package checksum verification framework and IPv6
 support. Experimental features include support for FTP, HTTPS (proxying only),
 Debian Bugs SOAP requests as well as the simultaneous caching of different
 repositories (e.g Debian and Ubuntu).
 .
 Apt-cacher can be used as a replacement for apt-proxy, with no need to modify
 client's /etc/apt/sources.list files (and even reusing its config and cached
 data), or as an alternative to approx.

 Based on the C.a.R. (Compass and Ruler) project, CaRMetal includes
 all of its functionalities - or almost. It propose a different approach
 from the graphical interface point of view.
 .
  - Ruler and compass constructions can be changed by dragging one of the
 basic construction points. The construction follows immediately. The
 student can check the correctness of the construction and gain new
 insight.
  - Tracks of points and animated constructions can help to understand
 geometric relations. Tracks can be used as new objects to explore.
  - With the macros of C.a.R. very complicated constructions become
 possible. Macros are also a way to organize the geometric thinking.
  - Hiding construction details and using colors make constructions
 clearer to read. In C.a.R. lines and circles can also be reduced to the
 relevant points.
  - Arithmetic computations, numerical solutions, curves and functions
 go beyond classical constructions. It is even possible to construct in 3D
 using advanced macros.
  - Other geometries, hyperbolic or elliptic, can be explored.
  - Scripting (javascript based) of figures.

 It consists of a pair of programs :
 `chronyd'.  This is a daemon which runs in background on the system.  It
 obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of the system's offset
 relative to other systems, and adjusts the system time accordingly.  For
 isolated systems, the user can periodically enter the correct time by hand
 (using `chronyc').  In either case, `chronyd' determines the rate at which
 the computer gains or loses time, and compensates for this.  Chronyd
 implements the NTP protocol and can act as either a client or a server.
 `chronyc'.  This is a command-line driven control and monitoring program.
 An administrator can use this to fine-tune various parameters within the
 daemon, add or delete servers etc whilst the daemon is running.

 CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other
 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for
 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Description-en: solves system lock-ups by making all processes non-realtime
 Das_Watchdog is a general watchdog for the Linux operating system that
 should be run in the background at all times to ensure a realtime process
 won't hang the machine.
 .
 Das_Watchdog is inspired by the rt_watchdog program from Florian Schmidt,
 but has some improvements over it:
  * It works with 2.4 kernels as well as 2.6.
  * Instead of permanently setting all realtime processes to run
    non-realtime, das_watchdog only sets them temporary.
  * When the watchdog kicks in, an X window should pop up that tells you
    whats happening (just close it after reading the message).

Package: davfs2
Description-md5: f8eed21b7f3e0ce6b263a0f4db368796
Description-en: mount a WebDAV resource as a regular file system
 Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV), an extension to the
 HTTP-protocol, allows authoring of resources on a remote
 web server. davfs2 provides the ability to access such resources like
 a typical filesystem, allowing for use by standard applications with no
 built-in support for WebDAV.
 .
 davfs2 is designed to fully integrate into the filesystem semantics of
 Unix-like systems (mount, umount, et c.). davfs2 makes
 mounting by unprivileged users as easy and secure as possible.
 .
 davfs2 does extensive caching to make the file system responsive,
 to avoid unnecessary network traffic and to prevent data loss, and to cope
 for slow or unreliable connections.
 .
 davfs2 will work with most WebDAV servers needing little or no configuration.

Package: firebird2.5-super
Description-md5: aacd7962ba6f641836562131f24e22c0
Description-en: Firebird Super Server - an RDBMS based on InterBase 6.0 code
 Firebird is a relational database offering many ANSI SQL-99 features that
 runs on Linux, Windows, and a variety of Unix platforms. Firebird offers
 excellent concurrency, high performance, and powerful language support
 for stored procedures and triggers. It has been used on production systems
 under a variety of names since 1981.
 .
 The "super" architecture uses separate threads to handle each connection.
 It has its advantages (eg: is usually faster and more efficient for large
 numbers of clients) but is unable to use more that one CPU on an SMP
 system and under some circumstances a client may crash all server threads.
 .
 This package contains the 2.5 branch of Firebird.
 .
 Firebird is a commercially independent project of C and C++ programmers,
 technical advisors and supporters developing and enhancing a multi-platform
 relational database management system based on the source code released by

Description-en: Firebird embedded client/server library
 Firebird is a relational database offering many ANSI SQL-99 features that
 runs on Linux, Windows, and a variety of Unix platforms. Firebird offers
 excellent concurrency, high performance, and powerful language support
 for stored procedures and triggers. It has been used on production systems
 under a variety of names since 1981.
 .
 This package contains libfbembed - the embedded client/server library for
 Firebird.
 .
 It can work with remote Firebird servers (either super-server or classic) via
 TCP connections, in the same way libfbclient does.
 .
 Contrary to libfbclient, libfbembed is not thread-safe.
 .
 When working with local database libfbembed works directly with the database
 file without the need of a separate server process. It needs a separate lock
 manager -- fb_lock_mgr -- which is in firebird2.5-classic package.
 .
 If you are in doubt, you most probably need libfbclient2, instead of this
 package.

Package: gnupg
Description-md5: 8bbdb812806fb623e26b7b93f549c74b
Description-en: GNU privacy guard - a free PGP replacement
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880.
 .
 GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to
 the version 2 series, shipped with the gnupg2 package, it comes
 with no support for S/MIME and some other tools useful for desktop
 environments, but also with less dependencies.
 .
 The gnupg package is built without libcurl. So it does not support
 HKPS keyservers. Install the gnupg-curl package if you want to use
 the keyserver helper tools built with libcurl and supporting HKPS.
 .
 GnuPG does not use any patented algorithms. This means it cannot be
 compatible with PGP2, because that uses IDEA (which is patented in
 a number of countries).

Package: graphicsmagick
Description-md5: 49dce754c724afc2a734936e7250be4b
Description-en: collection of image processing tools
 GraphicsMagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate
 image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers
 a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.
 .
 The tools support a large variety of image formats from the widely used
 jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or image
 formats found on some photo CDs. They can convert between formats,
 concatenate several images into one, annotate and distort them, create
 thumbnails or manipulate the colormap. While all features are available
 from the command-line, the package also includes an image viewer that
 allows interactive manipulation.
 .
 Note that unlike ImageMagick, the GraphicsMagick tools are accessed
 through a single executable called 'gm'. Therefore, GraphicsMagick and
 ImageMagick can be used in parallel. Install package
 graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat to obtain a set of several executables
 that is compatible to ImageMagick's interface.

Description-en: format-independent image processing - debugging symbols
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.
 .
 This package contains debugging symbols for the gm executable as well as the
 C, C++, and Perl bindings. Tools like gdb and ltrace make use of these
 symbols.

 The GraphicsMagick libraries are a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offer
 programming interfaces that are mostly compatible. While there might be
 small differences, experience tells that many programs only use a compatible
 subset and build fine with either GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick.
 .
 While GraphicsMagick uses different names for libraries, classes, and
 helper applications in order to coexist with ImageMagick, this package
 intends to minimise porting efforts by exporting the GraphicsMagick
 interface with the usual ImageMagick names. Note that this package only
 tries to provide build-time compatibility. Run-time libraries of
 ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick are incompatible and cannot be interchanged.

 This package includes compatibility wrappers for the C, C++, and Perl
 libraries.

Description-en: Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts -- library
 Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts" capable
 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.

Description-en: rich set of graph drawing tools
 Graph drawing addresses the problem of visualizing structural information
 by constructing geometric representations of abstract graphs and networks.
 Automatic generation of graph drawings has important applications in key
 technologies such as database design, software engineering, VLSI and
 network design and visual interfaces in other domains. Situations where
 these tools might be particularly useful include:
 .
   * you would like to restructure a program and first need to understand
     the relationships between its types, procedures, and source files
   * you need to find the bottlenecks in an Internet backbone - not only
     individual links, but their relationships
   * you're debugging a protocol or microarchitecture represented as a
     finite state machine and need to figure out how a certain
     error state arises
   * you would like to browse a database schema, knowledge base, or
     distributed program represented graphically
   * you would like to see an overview of a collection of linked documents
   * you would like to discover patterns and communities of interest in a
     database of telephone calls or e-mail messages

 inside the Java platform.
 .
 Groovy can be used as an alternative compiler to javac to generate
 standard Java bytecode to be used by any Java project or it can be used
 dynamically as an alternative language such as for scripting Java objects,
 templating or writing unit test cases.
 .
 This package includes the Groovy API javadocs, and examples.

 both Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required to learn
 the language. Language constructs, such as if statements, for and while
 loops, and switch and try ... catch blocks function the same as these
 languages (or nearly so).
 .
 JavaScript is a superset of the ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ECMAScript) standard
 first introduced by Netscape and now led by the Mozilla project.

Description-md5: c843260f27a1eda8a06487a4add7ae06
Description-en: an alternative module compat with mod_fastcgi
 mod_fcgid is a high performance alternative to mod_cgi or mod_cgid,
 which starts a sufficient number instances of the CGI program to handle
 concurrent requests, and these programs remain running to handle further
 incoming requests. It is favored by the PHP developers, for example,
 as a preferred alternative to running mod_php in-process, delivering
 very similar performance.

Description-en: Multi-format archive and compression library (development files)
 The libarchive library provides a flexible interface for reading and writing
 archives in various formats such as tar and cpio. libarchive also supports
 reading and writing archives compressed using various compression filters such
 as gzip and bzip2. The library is inherently stream-oriented; readers serially
 iterate through the archive, writers serially add things to the archive.
 .
 Archive formats supported are:
 .
    * tar (read and write, including GNU extensions)
    * pax (read and write, including GNU and star extensions)
    * cpio (read and write, including odc and newc variants)
    * iso9660 (read and write, including Joliet and Rockridge extensions, with
      some limitations)
    * zip (read only, with some limitations, uses zlib)
    * mtree (read and write)
    * shar (write only)
    * ar (read and write, including BSD and GNU/SysV variants)
    * empty (read only; in particular, note that no other format will accept an
      empty file)
    * raw (read only)
    * xar (read only)
    * rar (read only, with some limitations)
    * 7zip (read and write, with some limitations)

Description-en: General purpose cryptographic library - utilities and data files
 Crypto++ is library for creating C++ programs which use cryptographic
 algorithms.  The library uses a Pipes & Filters architecture with heavy
 use of templates and abstract base classes.  The cryptographic
 tools include:
  * Authenticated encryption schemes (GCM, CCM, EAX),
  * High speed stream ciphers (Panama, Sosemanuk, Salsa20, XSalsa20),
  * AES and candidates (Rijndael, RC6, MARS, Twofish, Serpent, CAST-256),
  * Other symmetric block ciphers (IDEA, Triple-DES, Camellia, SEED,
    RC5, Blowfish, TEA, XTEA, Skipjack, SHACAL-2),
  * Block cipher modes of operation (ECB, CBC, CTS, CFB, OFB, CTR),
  * Message authentication codes (VMAC, HMAC, CMAC, CBC-MAC, DMAC,
    Two-Track-MAC),
  * Hash functions (SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, Tiger,
    WHIRLPOOL, RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-256, RIPEMD-160, RIPEMD-320),
  * Public-key cryptography (RSA, DSA, ElGamal, NR, RW, LUC, LUCELG,
    DLIES, ESIGN),
  * Padding schemes for public-key systems (PKCS#1, OAEP, PSS, PSSR,
    EMSA2, EMSA5),
  * Key agreement schemes (DH, MQV, LUCDIF, XTR-DH),
  * Elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA, ECNR, ECIES, ECDH, ECMQV),
  * Backwards compatibility algorithms (MD2, MD4, MD5, Panama Hash, DES,
    ARC4, SEAL 3.0, WAKE, WAKE-OFB, DESX, RC2, SAFER, 3-WAY, GOST,

Description-en: Off-the-Record Messaging library development files
 Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging Library
 .
 OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing:
  - Encryption
    - No one else can read your instant messages.
  - Authentication
    - You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
  - Deniability
    - The messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are
      checkable by a third party.  Anyone can forge messages after a
      conversation to make them look like they came from you.  However,
      _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages
      he sees are authentic and unmodified.
  - Perfect forward secrecy
    - If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation
      is compromised.
  .
  This package contains the header files and static libraries needed to
  develop applications using libotr.

Description-en: X cursor management library
 Xcursor is a simple library designed to help locate and load cursors for the
 X Window System.  Cursors can be loaded from files or memory and can exist in
 several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  When using
 images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render extension's
 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.

 This package provides an unstripped shared object with debugging symbols,
 useful to provide a backtrace with symbol names in a debugger; this
 facilitates interpretation of core dumps, and aids in finding logic errors in
 programs using this library (or the library itself).  The library is
 installed in /usr/lib/debug and can be used by placing that directory in the
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable when the code to be debugged is
 executed.  Non-programmers will likely have little use for this package.

Package: libxstream-java
Description-md5: 10c1dedc8716f96d83e51d094ab4032b
Description-en: Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again
 The features of the XStream library are:
 .
  - Ease of use. A high level facade is supplied that simplifies common
    use cases.
  - No mappings required. Most objects can be serialized without need
    for specifying mappings.
  - Performance. Speed and low memory footprint are a crucial part of
    the design, making it suitable for large object graphs or systems
    with high message throughput.
  - Clean XML. No information is duplicated that can be obtained via
    reflection. This results in XML that is easier to read for humans
    and more compact than native Java serialization.
  - Requires no modifications to objects. Serializes internal fields,
    including private and final. Supports non-public and inner classes.
    Classes are not required to have default constructor.
  - Full object graph support. Duplicate references encountered in the
    object-model will be maintained. Supports circular references.
  - Integrates with other XML APIs. By implementing an interface,
    XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree structure (not just
    XML).
  - Customizable conversion strategies. Strategies can be registered
    allowing customization of how particular types are represented as
    XML.
  - Error messages. When an exception occurs due to malformed XML,
    detailed diagnostics are provided to help isolate and fix the
    problem.
  - Alternative output format. The modular design allows other output
    formats. XStream ships currently with JSON support and morphing.

Description-en: daemon to synchronize local directories using rsync
 Lsyncd (Live syncing mirror daemon) uses rsync to synchronize local
 directories with a remote machine running rsyncd. Lsyncd watches
 multiple directories trees through inotify. The first step after
 adding the watches is to rsync all directories with the remote host,
 and then sync single file by collecting the inotify events. So lsyncd
 is a light-weight live mirror solution that should be easy to install
 and use while blending

Description-en: Metadata anonymisation toolkit
 Metadata consist of information that characterizes data. Metadata are
 used to provide documentation for data products. In essence, metadata
 answer who, what, when, where, why, and how about every facet of the
 data that are being documented.
 .
 Metadata within a file can tell a lot about you. Cameras record data
 about when a picture was taken and what camera was used. Office
 documents like PDF or Office automatically adds author and company
 information to documents and spreadsheets.
 .
 Maybe you don't want to disclose those information on the web.
 .
 Mat only removes metadata from your files, it does not anonymise their
 content, nor can it handle watermarking, steganography, or any too
 custom metadata field/system.
 .
 If you really want to be anonym, use format that does not contain any
 metadata, or better: use plain-text.
 .
 Formats supported to some extent are:
    - Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
    - JPEG (.jpeg, .jpg, ...)
    - Open Document (.odt, .odx, .ods, ...)

Package: memcached
Description-md5: c96e946324d6d6114d0daad2388780d3
Description-en: A high-performance memory object caching system
 Danga Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of LiveJournal.com,
 a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1
 million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of database servers.
 memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page
 load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the
 databases on a memcache miss.
 .
 memcached optimizes specific high-load serving applications that are designed
 to take advantage of its versatile no-locking memory access system. Clients
 are available in several different programming languages, to suit the needs
 of the specific application. Traditionally this has been used in mod_perl
 apps to avoid storing large chunks of data in Apache memory, and to share
 this burden across several machines.

Package: minissdpd
Description-md5: 3dd0e4ad410068e63a26f5f00889c896
Description-en: keep memory of all UPnP devices that announced themselves
 MiniSSDPd is a small daemon used by MiniUPnPc (a UPnP control point for IGD
 devices) to speed up device discoveries. MiniSSDPd keeps memory of all UPnP
 devices that announced themselves on the network through SSDP NOTIFY packets.
 MiniSSDPd also has the ability to handle all SSDP traffic received on a
 computer via the multicast group 239.255.255.250:1900.
 .
 MiniSSDPd receives NOTIFY packets and stores information contained for later
 use by UPnP Control Points on the machine. MiniSSDPd receives M-SEARCH packets
 and answers on behalf of the UPnP devices running on the machine. MiniUPnPd
 and MiniUPnPc are designed to take automatically advantage of MiniSSDPd
 running on the same computer. Just make sure that MiniSSDPd is started before
 any other UPnP program on the computer.

Package: nbd-client
Description-md5: 50b5081db709f9bc399b8b74366d1d8f
Description-en: Network Block Device protocol - client
 Network Block Device (NBD) is a client/server protocol that
 emulates a block device (such as a hard disk, a floppy, or a CD-ROM)
 over the network, thus giving the system the ability to swap over the
 network, or to use raw network disk space for other purposes.
 .
 However, writing to one Network Block Device from different clients
 simultaneously is not recommended, and would probably result in data
 loss. If you want multiple clients to share a remote resource, use a
 network file system such as NFS or Coda.
 .
 This package provides the client binary for NBD.

Description-en: client for setting system time from NTP servers
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpdate is a simple NTP client that sets a system's clock to match
 the time obtained by communicating with one or more NTP servers.  It
 is not sufficient, however, for maintaining an accurate clock in the
 long run.  ntpdate by itself is useful for occasionally setting the
 time on machines that do not have full-time network access, such as
 laptops.
 .
 If the full NTP daemon from the package "ntp" is installed, then
 ntpdate is not necessary.

 Objective Caml (OCaml) is an implementation of the ML language, based on
 the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system
 and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.
 .
 OCaml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode
 which is then interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly,
 generates compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is
 portable to essentially any 32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of
 generated programs is quite good for a bytecoded implementation:
 almost twice as fast as Caml Light 0.7. This compiler can be used
 either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces
 standalone programs, or as an interactive, toplevel-based system.
 .
 The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number
 of processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but
 the generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining
 the moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. It is not
 available on all arches though.

Package: pngquant
Description-md5: 1d0769779d5bab0eb300ce90eee9ee09
Description-en: PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image optimising utility
 pngquant is a command-line conversion utility to quantize and dither truecolor
 PNG images, especially those with a full alpha channel, down to 8-bit (or
 smaller) RGBA-palette PNGs. Such images are usually two to four times smaller
 than the full 32-bit versions, and partial transparency is preserved quite
 nicely. This makes pngquant especially useful both for Web sites and for
 PlayStation 2 development, where one of the texture formats is
 RGBA-palette-based (though not PNG-compressed).
 This is the same technique used for many of the images on the Miscellaneous
 Transparent PNGs page (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngs-img.html), and
 the results are often indistinguishable from the original, truecolor PNG
 images.
 .
 Optimizers (like pngcrush and optipng) optimize the compression, usually
 losslessly, while pngquant quantizes colors down to 256 (or fewer) distinct
 RGBA combinations, which is lossy.

Description-en: SELinux core policy utilities
 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux® kernel and a number
 of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
 mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
 kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
 improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access Control,
 and Multi-level Security.
 .
 This package contains the core policy utilities that are required
 for basic operation of an SELinux system.  These utilities include
 load_policy to load policies, setfiles to label filesystems, newrole
 to switch roles, run_init to run /etc/init.d scripts in the proper
 context, and restorecond to restore contexts of files that often get the
 wrong context.
 .
 It also includes the mcstransd to map a maching readable sensitivity label to
 a human readable form.  The sensitivity label is comprised of a sensitivity
 level (always s0 for MCS and anything from s0 to s15 for MLS) and a set of
 categories.  A ranged sensitivity label will have a low level and a high level
 where the high level will dominate the low level.  Categories are numbered
 from c0 to c1023.  Names such as s0 and c1023 and not easily readable by
 humans, so mcstransd translated them to human readable labels such as
 SystemLow and SystemHigh.

Package: potrace
Description-md5: 5318100ae24829ee9cf39f8d8dcd1996
Description-en: utility to transform bitmaps into vector graphics
 potrace is a utility for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming
 a bitmap into a smooth, scalable image. The input is a bitmap (PBM, PGM,
 PPM, or BMP format), and the default output is an encapsulated PostScript
 file (EPS). A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned data, such as
 company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The resulting image is
 not "jaggy" like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be rendered at any
 resolution.
 .
 potrace can currently produce the following output formats: EPS,
 PostScript, PDF, SVG (scalable vector graphics), Xfig, Gimppath, and PGM
 (for easy antialiasing). Additional backends might be added in the future.

Description-en: GNU R statistical computation and graphics system
 R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists
 of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger,
 access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs
 stored in script files.
 .
 The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
 Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the
 resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying
 implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.
 .
 The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows
 branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
 Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is
 possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the
 C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core
 functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a
 large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math
 computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide
 a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data
 presentations.
 .
 Additionally, over thousand extension "packages" are available from
 CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian packages,
 named 'r-cran-<name>'.
 .
 This package is a metapackage which eases the transition from the
 pre-1.5.0 package setup with its larger r-base package. Once installed, it
 can be safely removed and apt-get will automatically upgrade its components
 during future upgrades.  Providing this package gives a way to users to
 then only install r-base-core if they so desire.

Description-en: OpenStack Object Storage - libraries
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides the Python libraries that actually implement
 everything.

 Tcpreplay is aimed at testing the performance of a NIDS by
 replaying real background network traffic in which to hide
 attacks. Tcpreplay allows you to control the speed at which the
 traffic is replayed, and can replay arbitrary tcpdump traces. Unlike
 programmatically-generated artificial traffic which doesn't
 exercise the application/protocol inspection that a NIDS performs,
 and doesn't reproduce the real-world anomalies that appear on
 production networks (asymmetric routes, traffic bursts/lulls,
 fragmentation, retransmissions, etc.), tcpreplay allows for exact
 replication of real traffic seen on real networks.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Description-md5: e8a546d3317d374b2fe6f8a245b9e653
Description-en: debugging symbols for Tor

 Those symbols allow your debugger to assign names to your backtraces, which

Package: tor-geoipdb
Description-md5: d0b50c9cd91157b8c85856fd55e26d14
Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

Package: wget
Description-md5: 63a4a740bcd9e8e94bf661e4f1806e02
Description-en: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description-en: distributed multihead X server
 Xdmx is a proxy X server that uses one or more other X servers as its
 display device(s). It provides multi-head X functionality for displays that
 might be located on different machines. Xdmx functions as a front-end X server
 that acts as a proxy to a set of back-end X servers. All of the visible
 rendering is passed to the back-end X servers. Clients connect to the Xdmx
 front-end, and everything appears as it would in a regular multi-head
 configuration. If Xinerama is enabled (e.g., with +xinerama on the command
 line), the clients see a single large screen.

 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
